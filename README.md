# Ai-load-balancer

AI Load Balancer is an intelligent traffic distribution system that uses machine learning to dynamically route incoming web traffic to the most optimal server in real-time. The system considers key server performance metrics like CPU usage, memory load, network latency, and uptime to ensure balanced server loads and maximize performance.

#Features:

Real-time server monitoring with a classic dashboard.

Machine Learning model predicts the best server based on live data.

Live graph visualization of CPU, memory, latency, and uptime.

Server history logs and graph export for analysis (graph_output.png).

Supports line charts, annotated predictions, and server dropdown selection.

REST API built with Flask for data updates and model predictions.
